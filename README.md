# MathDay2020

Above are my two, three minute talks for Math Day 2020!

For each one there are associated htmls's representing the corresponding notebooks for each of the projects.  I can provide the actual notebooks upon request for anyone interested!  They are currently locked up in a docker image I can't deploy yet because I have other code running and the instance needs 18 gigs of RAM to launch, or I will lose the hSBM model.
